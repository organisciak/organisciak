### Hi there 👋, I'm Peter Organisciak!

- 🎓 I'm a tenured Associate Professor at the University of Denver, focusing on creativity and AI, and massive-scale text analysis.
- 🛠️ Currently on a research sabbatical until September 2024, I'm engaged in building new and interesting things and open to new partnerships or short-term collaborations.
- 💡 Ask me about my work with Large Language Models in creativity scoring, or working with relationship tagging of massive digital libraries.
- 🙋 Pronouns: identify He/Him, fine with ungendered alternatives
